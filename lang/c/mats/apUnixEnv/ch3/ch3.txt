$ 3.2 File Descriptors (fd.)

	def: A file descriptor is a non-neg. int.
		1) To the kernel, all open files are refferred to by fd's. 
		2) When opening an existing file or creating a new file, the kernel rets. a fd.
			 to the process.
		3) When we want to read or write a file, we id. the file with the fd. that was
			 returned by funcs 'open' or 'creat' as arg. to funcs 'read' or 'write'.


	**UNIX uses fd 0 with std input of a process, fd1 with std output, and fd2 with
		the std error.


$ 3.3 open and openat functions

	def: A file is opened or created by either calling the open or openat func.

	- the fd retd. by open/openat is guaranteed oto be the lowest unused fd.
	- the diff b/w relative/absolute pathname is that rel. does not begin with
		(/). Rel. specifies loc. relative to the curr. working dir.
	- the diff. b/w open/openat is that openat has the fd parameter. there are
		three possibilities:
		1) The path param. specifies absolute pathname. In this case, the fd.
			 param. is ignored and openat behaves like open.
		2) The path param. specifies relative pathname and fd param. specifies
			 the starting loc. in the file sys. where the rel. pathname is. The
			 fd. param. is obtained by opening the dir. where the rel. pathname
			 is to be evaluated.
		3) The path param. specifies rel. pathname and the fd. param. has a 
			 special value AT_FDCWD. In this case, the pathname is eval. @
			 the curr. working dir. and openat behaves like open.
